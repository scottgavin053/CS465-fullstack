# CS465-fullstack

## Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDB was used in order to be able to directly store JSON documents and be able to retrieve them. 

## How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON cannot contain functions and used more as a way to easily transfer data between multiple languages in a unified format. Using JSON allowed us to store data in the database for both the Express and Angular application to call and access.

## Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
By implementing handlebars into the html and typescript, we were able to improve readability and reusability of the code.

## How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course provided a lot of hands on experience in the overall process involved in being a full stack developer. Instead of having to build the Express application then having to replicate that in Angular, we built an API that allowed both websites to access the database and display information as needed.
